# School Tour Guide

Our project focuses on making a tour guide application which assists user in surfing various locations throughout the school and also review it.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Please note that our project was developed in npm version 5.6.0



### Installing

These step by step process will help you get the website up and running in no time

Install all the npm packages using the following command

```
npm install

You need to ensure that you have mongodb running in the background. You can easily do that by running the following command on a new window of the terminal.


```
sudo mongod
```
Ensure that the mongodb terminal instance keeps running all the time(till the time you want to use the website )

Now you need to seed the database for which you will use a simple command on the terminal.


```
npm run seed
```

Now finally you can go ahead and run the website by giving the following command.


```
npm start
```
